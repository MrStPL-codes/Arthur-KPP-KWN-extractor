# Arthur-KPP-KWN-extractor
This tool is from my archive!!
I programmed it while I was still learning to program.

A program that extracts text from Arthur and the Invisibles .KPP (PSP) or .KWN (PC) files.

It's horribly programmed and only works with the Polish and English versions, but it works.

I wrote the program a long time ago in order to transfer the Polish translation from PC to PSP.

If someone wants to change the character set, they have to manually add them to the code and recompile them.
